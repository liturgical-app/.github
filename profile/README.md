## Liturgical App âœ¨ðŸ“–

Liturgical App is a set of components that can be used to find information about the [liturgical calendar]()) of the [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England), including
[liturgical colours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgical_colours), and [saints' days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_of_saints_(Church_of_England)).

So far, we are working on the following components:

* [calendar](https://github.com/liturgical-app/calendar), a Python library to calculate the dates and colours
* [calendar-api](https://github.com/liturgical-app/calendar-api), a small API server to return data from the library
* [webapp](https://github.com/liturgical-app/webapp), a simple web app to display liturgical colours
* [charts](https://github.com/liturgical-app/charts), Helm charts to install these components on Kubernetes

In the future we hope to work on:

* a Wordpress plugin to display liturgical colours on Wordpress-based sites
* an Alexa skill so people can ask their Amazon Echo for liturgical information
